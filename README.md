## Info
This is made by [Callumgm](https://github.com/Callumgm/Cookies-Clean-GUI-Base/). the reason why I have this in my GitHub is because the origional one from Callumgm has many Errors and doesnt work perfectly. My version is the exact same version but just with the fixed errors. The errors was caused by missing Ressouce files which I extended. The missing souce files was rain_L.png, puddle.png and cloud.png. I also added the login_preview.png file which you dont need.

- This is just a template!
- The only functions included are a **Simple Login System** & **A clean dashboard page**
- You may use this for whatever u want! `u can give credit if u wish :) (Also to me, MJMODZZ) `

## Build from source
1. Download or Gitclone this project
2. Open `Tester.sln` with Visual Studio 2019
3. Add the Bunfiu
3. Open `FrmLogin.cs` and add your raw paste bin url on **line 58**
4. Build / Run the project (any problems feel free to contact me)

## How to fix Bunifu errors
- Download these 2 files:

[Bunifu.Core.dll](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946881469844946984/958073286061867018/Bunifu.Core.dll)
<br>
[Bunifu_UI_v1.5.3.dll](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946881469844946984/958073286548394095/Bunifu_UI_v1.5.3.dll)
<br>
(For this to be the exact same you need to have Visual Studio 2019 and not 2022 (Worked for me on Visual Studio 2022, u have to try by urself))
<br>
1. Left click on project then click "Add Reference"
2. And there at bottom of menu you can find Browse
3. You click on it and select the dll's then press OK
